            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There al≈øo appeared ≈øix hundred Foot, but they were all of Sir <hi>Robert Strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Regiment: they likewi≈øe were di≈ømi≈ø≈øed.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Letter</hi> ≈øent from the Committee, there was a Paper from the High Sheriffe of Yorke, wherein he ≈øhewed, That he had received a Warrant and Charge from His Maje≈øty, to forbeare the putting in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Order of Parliament concerning the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> and that he returned this an≈øwer, That to the be≈øt that po≈ø≈øibly he could, he would apply him≈øelfe to do faithfull ≈øervice, according to his Oath, both to King and Parliament.</p>

            <p>Captain <hi>Dunkin,</hi> was reported in the Hou≈øe to be at York, a very ≈øtirring Man in all the matters of the King, concerning the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 26. a Report was made to the Hou≈øe, That the Lord Keeper was ≈øuddenly gone away from <hi>London,</hi> and that it was thought to York to the King, and that he carried the broad Seale with him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 7 -->the Hou≈øe appointed Me≈ø≈øengers to goe in Po≈øt after him, and if they could overtake him, to bring him back again.</p>
            <p>There was al≈øo another report made from Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> that the Ships wherein the Ordinance and Ammunition that was brought out of the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Hull,</hi> was Shipped; were vnder ≈øaile and gone out of the River; withall, that Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> de≈øired that more Committees might be ≈øent to <hi>Hull,</hi> becau≈øe tho≈øe that were there la≈øt being gone, the whole burthen lay upon him only and his Sonne? which was too heavy for them to beare.
